  <h3 class="margin">This is an example of your stereotypical 14 year-old girl.</h3>
  <p class="left">The typical 14 year-old girl is often seen taking excessive mirror selfies. The mirror and bathroom, more commonly than not, are dirty. Cellphones are held up covering part of the face. Rubberbands are expected to be worn on the wrist as they are the 14 year-old girl's most exquisite jewelry. Duck faces are common, though not neccesary.</p>

  <h3 class="margin">What Is A 14 Year-Old Girl?</h3>
  <p class="left">A 14 year-old girl can be characterized in many ways. Most 14 year-old girls are freshmen in high school. Finally being high schoolers, after waiting almost a full decade and a half. The most common addiction amongst 14 year-old girls is super sugary Starbucks drinks, which they beg their parents or sibilings for often. 14 year-old girls <strong>live</strong> on social media. Any moment that is not Snapchatted or Instagrammed is a moment of their life that they cannot prove to their friends that they lived. How else is anyone supposed to know they had a venti double chocolatey chip frappuccino, nonfat, with extra whip and chocolate drizzle?</p>
